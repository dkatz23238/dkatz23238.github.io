In attempt to bring a standard open protocol for developing APIs im building a set of rules that will easily allows me to deploy RPA's in the cloud that I develop for any client, business or organization. I am in the process of building pybot-orchestrate a standard architecture that runs specific software that allows the orchestration of business oriented robotic process automations using pybotlib.
