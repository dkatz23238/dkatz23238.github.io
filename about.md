Vision
We aspire to become leaders in emerging markets enabling both individuals and organizations to migrate their business models into the 21st century giving them the power of data science and automation. We would like to educate business and individuals around the world about artificial intelligence, automation and the digital transformation process by providing clear and approachable online content
Customers
We provide both open source software solutions along with managed robotic process automation services and data science consulting.

#  Strategy
In order to reach our strategic vision we have constructed a set of business plans to engage with both our b2b and b2c markets respectively.

In order to maintain leadership status as automation, IT, security, AI, and BI experts one of our core values is the constant research and development of new ideas and concepts. Our R&D efforts are accompanied by the documentation and persistence of our knowledge within our internal company systems. As Cross Entropy grows we will add new members to our Thought Leadership and Innovation board, where highly skilled and experienced individuals in various fields decide on specific implementations and direction of company R&D efforts. By combining practical enterprise market analysis with academic research we are able to take advantage of the accelerated pace of innovation and change our field is experiencing. Our R&D governance models allow us to stay ahead of our competition in terms of practical expertise in enterprise automation and data science endeavors.

Our documented knowledge is then transformed into practical and theoretical training material to provide to both internal and external individuals.

Because we are able to swiftly develop and document best practices both in the world of BPM and technology we our organization can train low experience individuals and eventually deploy them to work for our clients, either consulting or educating

Our current R&D efforts have raised focus on 4 key products Cross Entropy will develop to satisfy market needs:

Software Development Cross Entropy stack: Develop open source RPA technologies to create standardize the automation processes in enterprises. Our software solution are pybotlib and pybotserver which are applications that allows businesses to conduct end to end RPA at enterprise scale with state of the art open technologies. pybotlib is accompanied by “The Enterprise Automation handbook”, which is an extensively detailed ebook teaching any individual how to develop robotic process automations using an open stack of technologies. Our ebook also serves to portray our ability to explain and educate on technical topics.

RPA E2E Consulting/Outsourcing: Even though the software we provide is free and open, most organizations will not find it profitable to invest in an internal RPA CoE implementation. For this reasons we provide end to end RPA consulting services where we analyze, design, develop and implement RPAs in an organization by setting up a centralized RPA CoE either within our IT infrastructure or our clients.

Corporate & University Trainings: We are highly skilled in training individuals (especially from the economical sciences background) on technical topics. Along with our free content we provide online, we grant specific corporate and university training programs in both Data Science and RPA development using open technologies.Cross entropy will be organizing local events where we talk about the technologies we work with and how they are impacting enterprises all around the world. Software Demos are shown for illustrative purposes.

Online Content Creation: Finally we provide constant, up to date, training and educational content from our different online pages. Any students can start to learn how to apply different digital technologies to their work. We teach about predictive analytics, ERP automation, and everything in between.
